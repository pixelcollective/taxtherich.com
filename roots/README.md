## Notes for friends

- This template uses lerna to manage JS dependencies and share a single tailwind configuration file between all plugins and themes that tap into it. To build stuff you run `yarn` and `yarn build` from `/bedrock`, not the theme/plugin dirs. If you need to add a dependency to either the theme or a plugin you add the dependency where it is being utilized, as normal. Afterward, run `yarn` in `bedrock` again to sync the dependency with the `yarn workspace`.

- This starter uses Tiny Pixel Co's `tiny-packagist` satispress. In order to use this project outside of Tiny Pixel you will need to remove those dependencies from `bedrock/composer.json` (in both `"repositories"` and `"require"`.) You will also need to modify the `build-after.yml` to not pull from `tiny-packagist`, as you will not have authentication and this will cause deploys to fail.

- Currently, `Acorn` packages are installed to the theme directory. The `acorn-roles`, `acorn-admin-menu` and `acorn-models` packages are intended to be consumed by the theme. I will update this template when those changes are made.
